------
*almonds use 1/2 of all farmed bees to pollinate
*coconut sometimes uses animals to collect the coconuts
*vanilla uses the most water per pound of any food to grow
*cashews and avocados (only the ones from Mexico) have had labor violations associated with them. With cashews, it's the toxin that burns people.
*truffles (I mean the mushroom) use animals (like dogs and pigs) to find them
*rest is from the fair trade labor - which is due to these industries having a lot of labor violations.
*black pepper - late 2010s saw a lot of issues in supply due to weather and prices
*salt for roads is bad for the environment - https://www.mashed.com/160965/the-untold-truth-of-salt/
*groundwater extraction contributes to droughts/cities sinking and bottled is a part of it
*cotton production amages the environment
*charcoal is associated with slahs and burn agriculture, which hurts forests: https://theconversation.com/madagascars-unique-spiny-forest-is-fast-being-turned-into-charcoal-58323
*palm oil is bad for orangutans
*heavy water use that wildlife needs: golf, pool, swim, swimming
