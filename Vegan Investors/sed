I created a file called hi.txt. In it I wrote: mary had a little lamb. This is what it looks like when I use sed:

remove before text:
sed 's/.*had//' hi.txt
 a little lamb

remove after text:
sed 's/little.*//' hi.txt
mary had a

remove both before and after text:
 sed 's/.*had//; s/little.*//' hi.txt
 a
 
 won't take ' for quotes (put them around little l):
sed -e 's/.*a//; s/'little l'.*//' hi.txt
sed: -e expression #1, char 17: unterminated `s' command

won't take " as quotes either (around the same text):
sed -e 's/.*a//; s/"little l".*//' hi.txt
sed: can't read hi.txt: No such file or directory
