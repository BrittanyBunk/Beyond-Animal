Notes:
* Sed isn't able to work with url's. Url's need to be curl'd and then piped to be able to do so, like: curl "website" | sed (part to cut) | grep term
* Using a : will rewrite a file, while / will print it out on the screen.

I created a file called hi.txt. In it I wrote: mary had a little lamb. This is what it looks like when I use sed:

remove before text:
sed 's/.*had//' hi.txt
 a little lamb

remove after text:
sed 's/little.*//' hi.txt
mary had a

remove both before and after text:
 sed 's/.*had//; s/little.*//' hi.txt
 a
 
 won't take ' for quotes (put them around little l):
sed -e 's/.*a//; s/'little l'.*//' hi.txt
sed: -e expression #1, char 17: unterminated `s' command

won't take " as quotes either (around the same text):
sed -e 's/.*a//; s/"little l".*//' hi.txt
sed: can't read hi.txt: No such file or directory

only / works in sed for reading url's. : doesn't work (because it's trying to rewrite a file it doesn't have - url's can't be changed):
curl "https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SPLK/profile" | sed -i -e "s:corporate .*::g" | grep -ic dairy
curl: (23) Failed writing body (866 != 1300)
